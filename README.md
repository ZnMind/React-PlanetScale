## React PlanetScale Database Connection

This is a React front end to connect to a MySQL [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) database. This pulls the results of every single North American Professional League of Legends game.


### Vercel Express Server

The back end server is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for connecting to the database. Code can be found [Here](https://github.com/ZnMind/PlanetScale-Vercel)


### Webscraper

The database was automatically populated from a [Puppeteer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/) webscraper that I built [Here](https://github.com/ZnMind/Webscraping-into-PlanetScale-DB).
